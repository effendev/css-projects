# Personal CSS Projects

In this repository, I keep all the CSS projects I have done. The goal is to keep practicing to write a good CSS and become comfortable with pure CSS.

Though much of the project will become one time project only, I will make sure to keep updating all the projects as I gain more CSS knowledge and practical CSS skill in the future. 

Have a wonderful day, visitor.
